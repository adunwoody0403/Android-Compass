# Android Compass
This is a compass app made for Android devices built using Microsoft's Xamarin C# framework. The application acts like a real compass would in real life, using the device's magnetometer to sense the earth's magnetic field. The app responds to the tap gestures and the device theme. For enhanced visual fidelity, the app uses the device's gyroscope to keep the compass face level with the ground, regardless of device orientation.
